    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
        <li>Soak the rice cakes in warm water for 10 mins.
        <br>(If you are using fresh rice cakes that are already tender, feel free to skip this step).
        <br>If using refrigerated rice cake sticks,  it is recommended to soak them 
        <br>to enhance their moisture level before proceeding with the recipe.
        <br>boil according to instructions on package, about 5 to 10 minutes, until soft.</li>
                <br>
        <li>Boil the soup stock in a shallow pot over medium high heat and dissolve the tteokbokki sauce by stirring it with a spatula. 
        <br>Once the seasoned stock is boiling, add the rice cakes, fish cakes and onion. Boil them a further 3 to 5 mins until the rice cakes are fully cooked.
        <br>Then, to thicken the sauce and to deepen the flavor, simmer it over low heat for a further 2 to 4 mins.</li>
                <br>
        <li>Add the sesame oil, sesame seeds, and green onion then quickly stir. Serve warm.</li>
            </ol>
