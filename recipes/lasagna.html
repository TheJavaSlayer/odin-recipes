    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
        <li>Put pasta water on to boil:</li>
        <br>
        <img src="boiling-water.jpg" width="250" height="250">
    <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat.
        <br>It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water),
        <br>So it is of your best interest to prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Brown the ground beef:</li>
        <br>
        <img src="browned-beef.jpg" width="250" height="250">
        <br>
    <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. 
        <br>Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
        <br>Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>
        <br>
    <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:</li>
        <br>
    <img src="bellp-garl-oni.jpd.jpg" width="250" height="250">
        <br>
        <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).
        <br>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened.
        <br> Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
        <br>Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
        <br>
    <li>Make the sauce:</li>
        <br>
        <img src="salsa-lasagna.jpg" width="250" height="250">
        <p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. 
        <br>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.
        <br>Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. 
        <br>Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. 
        <br>Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste.
        <br> (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you are using.)</p>
        <p>Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty.</p>
        <p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often.
        <br>Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.</p>
        <p>Remove from heat.</p>
        <br>
    <li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</li>
        <br>
    <img src="drain-pasta.jpg" width="250" height="250">
        <br>
        <p>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. 
        <br>Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions. 
        <br>(Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)</p>
        <p>Stir often to prevent from sticking.
        <br>Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.</p>
        <p>When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.</p>
        <p>Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet,
        <br>turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking together.</p>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Layer the lasagna:</li>
    <br>
    <img src="assembling-lasagna.jpg" width="250" height="250">
    <br>
    <p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish.
    <br>Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, the edges may overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce.
    <br>Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.</p>
    <p>Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagna sauce. 
    <br>Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple of inches.
    <br>Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.</p>
    <p>Apply the second layer of noodles and top it with half of the remaining sauce. 
    <br>Add half of the remaining mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.</p>
    <p>Finish with another layer of noodles, and <em>finally,</em> 
    <br>Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</p>
    <br>
    <li>Bake:</li>

    <p>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce. Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. 
    <br>Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.</p>
    <br>
    <li>Cool and serve:</li>
    <br>Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. 
    <br> You can reheat it in a conventional oven or microwave. Leave the aluminum tent on for storage.
    <br>(Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)
            </ol>
