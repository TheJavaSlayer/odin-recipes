    <h4>*To assemble the Lasagna*</h4>
            <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles(requires 9 lasagna noodles - <strong>unbroken</strong>)</li>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
        <li>Put pasta water on to boil:</li>
    <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat.
        <br>It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water),
        <br>So it is of your best interest to prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>

        <br>Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
        <br>Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>
