    <h2><em>**Pro Tips**</em></h2>
            <ul>
        <li><em>Cook time: All microwaves are different so it’s difficult to give a precise cook time. Start with 70 seconds, 
            <br>wait 1 minute while it cools, then look to see if it is set. Add an additional 15-25 seconds if needed. 
            <br>Allow it to rest in the microwave for 1 minute.</em></li>
            </ul>
    <h2>ENJOY!! :)</h2>
